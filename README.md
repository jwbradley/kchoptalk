# kchoptalk
This is the code that runs on the kchoptalk.com website.

It's the sort of site one builds when they get tire of the manual processes needed to maintain a content curation website. Almost all of the processes in this code were developed from manual steps that I wished to automate. The first iterations of this code consisted of some basic code to scrape content from a Google search. 

From there, I ended up ditching the idea that Google could deilver great content without any interactions on my part, because as you know there tend to be things listed in a search that have nothing related to your thoughts or ideas. So, I decided to incorporated other tools that I could use to help me deliver output to the user.  At that time I was already using buffer.com and feedly.com to help me deilver articles content onto various social media sites, and by getting subscriptions to each of them, I could then use API's to assist in automating more of the content. Both of these external sites had their challenges, but I feel like I've been successful using them to automate the content that gets delivered to the user.
