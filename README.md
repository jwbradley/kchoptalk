# kchoptalk
This is the code that runs on the kchoptalk.com website.

It's the sort of site one builds when they get tire of the manual processes needed to maintain a content curation website. Almost all of the processes in this code were developed from manual steps that I wished to automate. The first iterations of this code consisted of some basic code to scrape content from websites. 

From there, I ended up ditching the ideas behind scraping content from other sites, and going in a completely different direction. So with an idea to automating content delivery, I decided to incorporated other tools that I could use to help me deliver output to the user.  At that time I was already using buffer.com and feedly.com to help me find and deilver content to various social media sites. These sites allow me to use API's to assist with automation of content. These sites have their challenges, and I feel like I've successfully incorportated them to delivere content to the user.
